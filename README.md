# Pokemon
This is a C++ program attempting to recreate the early Pokemon games.
I have restricted myself to using C++ for this project to better my
understanding of the language and data types. Currently, I have decided
to move forward with the SFML library for developing the GUI and handling
the actual sprite manipulation.

## pokemonData.csv
This is the csv file that will eventually hold of the pokemons' base data
for loading and creating

## PCData.csv
This is the csv file created by the PC to save and load pokemon from

## pokemon stats.py
Not completed yet, but this is a python program that will be used to webscrape
all of the pokemon data needed to fill out the pokemonData.csv

## pokemon names.txt
The text file required by "pokemon stats.py". It will contain the name of every
pokemon I need to webscrape data for.
